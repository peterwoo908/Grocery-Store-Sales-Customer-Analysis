# Grocery-Store-Sales-Customer-Analysis

<div style="font-size: 24px; color: red;">This dataset comes from a ficticious grocery store by an owner names Gerry. Gerry is investigating a potential promotion and also wants to identify ways to improve his sales/marketing strategy. They offer a membership that results in 20% off all items for a monthly fee of $999. However, they are offering a discounted membership price of $499. They want insight on their customer behavioral data and to find out which customers are the best options to target for this promotion.
