# Grocery-Store-Sales-Customer-Analysis

<div style="font-size: 24px; color: red;">This dataset comes from a ficticious grocery store by an owner names Gerry. Gerry is investigating a potential promotion and also wants to identify ways to improve his sales/marketing strategy. They offer a membership that results in 20% off all items for a monthly fee of $999. However, they are offering a discounted membership price of $499. They want insight on their customer behavioral data and to find out which customers are the best options to target for this promotion.

This project will consist of Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Analysis, Customer Segmentation, and lastly Predictive Analysis.</div>
